Hi, I'm Indranil Chakraborty and I'm a technology professional based out of Austin, Texas. 

This blog covers my technology interest areas which include Cybersecurity, Identity and Access Management, DevSecOps, and automating the mundane. I'll also be sharing my thoughts on project implementation and delivery based on my experiences as a technology consultant since 2004.
